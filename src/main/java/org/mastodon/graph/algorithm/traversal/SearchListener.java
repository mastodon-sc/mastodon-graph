/**
 * Interface for classes interacting with {@link GraphSearch}es.
 * <p>
 * The {@link GraphSearch} hierarchy does not implement the iterator interface
 * and upon calling {@link GraphSearch#start(Vertex)}, the search processes
 * until complete without stopping. The {@link SearchListener} interface allows
 * interacting with the search using notifications. Specific methods of this
 * interface are called when a vertex is discovered, is done being processed,
 * when an edge is traversed or when a connected component has been iterated
 * completely.
 * <p>
 * These methods have the actual graph search instance as parameter, so that,
 * <ul>
 * <li>the search can be stopped via {@link GraphSearch#abort()},
 * <li>the class of an edge can be queried with
 * {@link GraphSearch#edgeClass(Vertex, Vertex)}
 * <li>the parent of a vertex in the search tree can be queried with
 * {@link GraphSearch#parent(Vertex)}
 * </ul>
 * Searches inheriting from {@link GraphSearch} might add some extra useful
 * methods, specific to the search strategy they implement.
 * <p>
 * The method names follow the framework of
 * <a href="http://www.algorist.com/">Skiena</a>.
