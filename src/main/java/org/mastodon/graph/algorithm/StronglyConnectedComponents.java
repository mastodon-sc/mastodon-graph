/**
 * A class to generate the strongly connected components of a directed graph.
 * Implements <a href=
 * "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm">Tarjan's
 * strongly connected components algorithm</a>.
 * <p>
 * TODO: The current implementation is recursive, processes the whole graph
 * immediately, and collects all strongly connected components into a
 * {@code HashSet}. It is therefore not really suited to very large or deep
 * graphs. It would be better to convert recursion to iteration, then process
 * until one SCC is completed, and provide access to SCCs through an iterator.
