/**
 * Branch graph: a branch simplification view of a source graph.
 * <p>
 * This specific instance supports branch edges and vertices with features.
 * <p>
 * This class implements a view of a source {@link ListenableGraph} (called here
 * <i>linked graph</i>) that offers a coarser level of details by representing
 * branches of the linked graph as a single vertex and edge in the branch graph.
 * <p>
 * A branch in the linked graph is defined as connected vertices that have
 * exactly 1 incoming edge and 1 outgoing edge. In the branch graph, a branch is
 * represented as follow. If in the linked graph a branch is like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * v0 &#8594; v1 &#8594; v2 &#8594; v3
 * </pre>
 *
 * The its representation in the branch graph is:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  bv0 &#8594; bv1
 * </pre>
 *
 * where:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>bv0</code> links to <code>v0</code>,
 * <li><code>bv1</code> links to <code>v3</code>,
 * <li>all linked vertices in-between linked to the branch edge between
 * <code>bv0</code> and <code>bv1</code>,
 * <li>as well as all the linked edges in the branch.
 * <li>The branch edge between <code>bv0</code> and <code>bv1</code> links to
 * the outgoing edge of <code>v0</code>.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For instance, a graph laid as following:
 *
 * <pre>
 *                 v3 &#8594; v4 &#8594; v5
 *              /
 * v0 &#8594; v1 &#8594; v2
 *              \
 *                 v6 &#8594; v7 &#8594; v8
 * </pre>
 *
 * will be represented by the following branch graph:
 *
 * <pre>
 *            bv2
 *          /
 * bv0 &#8594; bv1
 *          \
 *            bv3
 * </pre>
 *
 * In the example above, <code>v0</code>, <code>v2</code>, <code>v5</code> and
 * <code>v8</code> are <b>branch extremities</b>; they are linked to a unique
 * branch vertex in the branch graph. <code>v1</code>, <code>v3</code>,
 * <code>v4</code>, <code>v6</code> and <code>v7</code> belongs to a branch.
 * They link to a branch edge.
 *
 * <p>
 * The branch graph is based on a non-simple directed graph. There might be more
 * than one edge between the same source and target branch vertices. This
 * happens for instance when there is a diamond-like shape in the linked graph:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     v1 &#8594; v2 &#8594; v3
 *   /             \
 * v0               v7
 *   \             /
 *     v4 &#8594; v5 &#8594; v6
 * </pre>
 *
 * In the branch graph, this becomes:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     ____
 *    /    \
 * bv0      bv1
 *    \____/
 * </pre>
 *
 * The branch graph can also handle ring-link structures in the linked graph. In
 * that case, such a ring;
 *
 * <pre>
 *     v1 &#8594; v2 &#8594; v3
 *   /             \
 * v0               v4
 *   \             /
 *     v7 &#8592; v6 &#8592; v5
 * </pre>
 *
 * is represented by a single vertex having a loop-edge:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    _
 * bv0 \
 *  \__/
 * </pre>
 *
 * In such a loop, the vertex linked to <code>bv0</code> and the edge linked to
 * the branch edge are determined by the order in which the vertices and edges
 * are added in the linked graph.
 * <p>
 * The branch graph is defined and tested only for <b>simple, directed
 * graphs</b> as linked graph. Using any other classes of graphs will result in
 * unexpected behavior.
 *
 * @param <BV>
 *            the type of the branch vertices.
 * @param <BE>
 *            the type of the branch edges.
 * @param <V>
 *            the type of linked vertices.
 * @param <E>
 *            the type of linked edges.
