/**
 * TODO: javadoc
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>Important:</em> Derived classes need to define "constructor" methods
 * (preferably called {@code init(...)} and users <em>must</em> call one of
 * these immediately after creating vertices. The {@code init(...)} methods
 * <em>must</em> call {@link #initDone()} as their last step.
 * <p>
 * The reason: {@link ListenableReadOnlyGraph} should emit the
 * {@link GraphListener#vertexAdded(Vertex)} event only after some basic
 * initialization has happened on the newly created vertex. It is therefore not
 * emitted in {@link Graph#addVertex()} but instead in {@link #initDone()}.
 * <p>
 * Idiomatically, adding a vertex to a graph should look like this:<br>
 * {@code MyVertex v = graph.addVertex().init(...);}<br>
 * respectively:<br>
 * {@code MyVertex v = graph.addVertex(ref).init(...);}
 * <p>
 * Like a constructor, {@code init(...)} should be called before any other
 * method, and only once. {@link AbstractListenableVertex} tries to do some
 * basic detection of violations of this rule (throwing
 * {@link IllegalStateException} if it finds anything).
 * <p>
 * TODO: It would be nice to be able to enforce this at compile time, but I
 * couldn't find a good solution to achieve that.
 *
 *
 * @param <V>
 *            the concrete type of this vertex.

 *            the type of the pool on which vertices are built
 * @param <T>
