/**
 * Mother class for edge of <b>directed, listenable</b> graphs.
 * <p>
 * Graphs based on this edge class do not have a limitation on the number of
 * edges between a source and target vertices.
 * <p>
 * <em>Important:</em> Derived classes need to define "constructor" methods
 * (preferably called {@code init(...)} and users <em>must</em> call one of
 * these immediately after creating edges. The {@code init(...)} methods
 * <em>must</em> call {@link #initDone()} as their last step.
 * <p>
 * The reason: {@link ListenableReadOnlyGraph} should emit the
 * {@link GraphListener#edgeAdded(Edge)} event only after some basic
 * initialization has happened on the newly created edge. It is therefore not
 * emitted in {@link Graph#addEdge(Vertex, Vertex)} but instead in
 * {@link #initDone()}.
 * <p>
 * Idiomatically, adding an edge to a graph should look like this:<br>
 * {@code MyEdge e = graph.addEdge(...).init(...);}
 * <p>
 * Like a constructor, {@code init(...)} should be called before any other
 * method, and only once. {@link AbstractListenableEdge} tries to do some basic
 * detection of violations of this rule (throwing {@link IllegalStateException}
 * if it finds anything).
 * <p>
 * TODO: It would be nice to be able to enforce this at compile time, but I
 * couldn't find a good solution to achieve that.
 *
 * @param <E>
 *            the concrete type of this edge.
 * @param <V>
 *            the type of vertex in the graph.
 * @param <EP>
 *            the type of the pool on which edges are built
 * @param <T>
 *            the type of mapped element on which the edge pool is built.
